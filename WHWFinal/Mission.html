<h2>The Problem</h2>
<div id="theProblem" style="color:darkslategray">Berkeley, California has an estimated population of 1,100 homeless people and this number continues to rise.  While homeless women make up about the same percentage of the homeless population as men, they are rarely recognized or even counted in homeless statistics.  Most homeless women stay in a car or couch surf because staying on the street is too dangerous.  On top of not having a safe place to stay or access to resources, homeless women have to face the dangers of being a woman, which are further amplified by their situation.  Many homeless women are victims of domestic violence, sexual harm, drug abuse, health issues, and mental health illnesses.  Not only do these women have to care for themselves, but some of them have children to care for as well.  In addition, many homeless women do not have access to necessary hygiene products (such as pads, tampons, and soap) or health services (such as medicine, check ups, and rehabilitation).  Despite everything that homeless women go through, their experiences are rarely acknowledged or discussed.  This leads to homeless women becoming invisible in the eyes of the rest of the population, which causes their problems to be ignored.  We have found that while there are many projects and systems of support for the homeless, there are few aimed to help women.

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<div id="ourGoal" class = "boxed" style="color:darkslategray">The goal of Women Helping Women, is to create a platform where the experiences of homeless women in Berkeley can be documented, acknowledged, and shared.  We want to create a community that unites all women of berkeley.  By creating this website we hope to establish a safe space where homeless women can be acknowledged for the struggles they have faced.  Humanizing these women will incentivise empathizers to donate, improving lives and spreading the love and positivity that we know exists in our community.
